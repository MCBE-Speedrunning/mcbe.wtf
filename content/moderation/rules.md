Minecraft Bedrock Speedrunning moderation team keeps the rules in a git
repository, currently hosted on GitHub. In the past this repository has
been hosted on multiple platforms, such as troll's raspberry pi.

Git was chosen as it was the easiest tool for both community
contributions as well as keeping a detailed log for when the rules
change and why. While in reality only 3-4 people actually know how to
use git, the dream lives on.

We generally accept rule contributions from anyone willing to write the
rules.

How to change the rules
-----------------------

Rules SHOULD first be discussed in #leaderboard-discussion or with an
existing moderator. Once the general change has been discussed and
decided, the rules should be updated.

Administrators can push directly to master, and should hopefully be
aware on how not to ruin a git repository. Everyone else MUST go
through the Pull Request procedure.

Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
