While not a part of Minecraft Bedrock Speedrunning, many of the bedrock
moderators partake in the process of adding new maps, servers, and
minigames "games" to speedrun.com.

The Bedrock Moderators are also responsible for the form people use to
submit new games, and as such this document serves as a quick intro.

What
----
The site is a deno serverless application, who's job is to take user
input and post it on discord through a webhook. As of today only Troll
has access to the infrastructure running the site, as such if there are
any questions or concerns please get in touch.

New Games
---------
[form.mcbe.wtf](https://form.mcbe.wtf/) explains quite well what we
expect of users to submit.

The general consensus is that bedrock moderators approve/deny bedrock
games, java moderators approve/deny java games, and everyone
approves/denies miscellaneous submissions.

At least 2 moderators should agree in an approval/rejection, and one
should get in contact with the original submitter to let them know of
the decision.
