Welcome to the moderator team, glad to have you. If you made it this far
then one or more moderators think you've got what it takes to retime
some runs in the weekend from time to time.

Your job from here will mostly be to examine, retime, approve and reject
runs. In doubt feel free to ask in the closest moderator channel on what
to do.

We expect moderators to also be relatively active on discord as well as
the forums, and moderate those as such.
