This document aims to provide guidelines for what to do in the case of a
sensitive investigation.

A sensitive investigation is most commonly refers to a cheated run or a
cheating player.

These investigations must be handled with care. If anything gets out it
can potentially lead to accusations and harassment for anyone involved,
runners and moderators alike. As such we wish to keep such cases to
ourselves for as long as possible.

Dialog with the other party
---------------------------
When we wish to start a dialog with the other party the following points
are essential

1. It is kept private, and messages from the other party are shared with
   their explicit consent
2. All current moderators have access to the discussion with the other
   party.
3. The messages are archived for future reference.
4. The dialog from the moderators should be handled by a few select
   moderators, and the discussion topics should be agreed upon by
   moderators before they are brought up with the other party.
5. The dialog from the moderators should be in a respectful and friendly
   tone, yet assertive if necessary. The moderators should not talk as
   if they are on.

To achieve these points the following system will be put in place

A new Private Discord Channel Category will be added which will
include the following channels:

1. `#$SUBJECT-dialog`
2. `#$SUBJECT-mods`

Where `$SUBJECT` is the end of the URL of a speedrun.com run link.

If the discussion is not about a run then the other party's username or
other identifier shall be used.

### `#$SUBJECT-dialog`
This channel will be where all current moderators will have read
permissions, and where the other party will have read and send messages
permissions.

Permissions to the other party will be given directly and without the
use of special roles.

2 or more moderators will be selected to be given send message
permissions. They will handle the discussion with the other party and
speak on behalf of the moderation team.

### `#$SUBJECT-mods`
This channel will be where all moderator-related discussion will happen,
where all current moderators will have read and send messages
permissions, and can speak, pin, and otherwise do whatever.

Verdict
-------
When a verdict is reached an announcement will be sent to the other
party informing them of our decision. They will have 48 hours to
respond, after which we will put the decision in effect, and reject or
approve the run as needed.

If new evidence comes to light the verdict will be postponed until the
moderators can come to a new conclusion.

If the subject at matter is of interest to a large number of people in
the community then an announcement will be made.

The announcement shall respect the wishes of the other party, when it
comes to sharing messages, videos, names, or other information.
