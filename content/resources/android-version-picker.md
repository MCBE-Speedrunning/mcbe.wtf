On Android the game is commonly downloaded from Google's Play Store. By
using an alternative store app it is possible to download older
versions.

## Disclaimer

You MUST buy the game through Google Play for this to work. This WILL
NOT work with Minecraft that comes from other sources.

Not all versions are available, and not all versions are available for
all devices. If a version is not in the list below for your device it is
possible that the version was not compiled for your device. That means
that without the help of Mojang you won't be able to play that version.

## Guide

1. Download the [Aurora Store](https://aurorastore.org/)
2. Log in, and find [Minecraft](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe)
3. Before downloading, press the 3 dots in the top right corner, and
   click "Manual Download"
4. Input a version from the list below.
   - The version is not "1.12.1.1" (for example), but 871120101,
     depending on your device. If in doubt, try them all until it
     works. If none work, then the version might not be available for
     your device or you might not be logged in.
