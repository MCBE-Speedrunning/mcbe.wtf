Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Unofficial Category Extensions (MCBEUCE for
short) is a leaderboard on [speedrun.com](https://speedrun.com/mcbeuce)
which houses a different set of categories not worthy/good enough to be
on the main leaderboards. It is managed by a separate team of moderators
and has it's own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AApQttKaBA). It
started as an unofficial project by a couple runners but has since grown
to a popular extension of the MCBE leaderboards.
