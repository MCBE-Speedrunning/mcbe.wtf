This is OphieSR's 1.20+ Practice Map. I made it myself over the course
of a year or two, and it is filled with hundreds of command blocks and
redstone to make practicing speedruns easy. Here is what the map has (so
far):

- A complete one cycle practice map. Filled with more items and options
  than any other MCBE practice map. 20+ items, 4 end terrains, different
  perch timings, different game modes, and even a jump cycle timing
  practice.
- A complete portal practice section with every single ruined portal,
  lava pool, stronghold portal room, and even ocean ravine and woodland
  mansion portal building practice maps. 
- In depth PVP practice for you and your friends. 20+ items to choose
  from and multiple settings to make things interesting
- Complete MLG/Clutch practice for all the ways to reduce fall damage in
  a speedrun
- There are some parts of the map that are works in progress as well
- Nether fortress practice
- Bastion practice
- Crafting practice
- These areas have some steps complete but not all

I hope this map helps you become a better speedrunner. If you have any
questions, DM @OphieSR on discord.
