This map works for versions 1.21.50 and above, and I believe it is the
best and fastest end fight practice map out there for current version. 

- click the "start practice" button to start practice
- throw your pickaxe to respawn the dragon
- throw your recovery compass to go back to the lobby
- choose new items and then click the "start with new inventory" button to set custom inventories
- click the "more options" button for much more cool customizations

Any questions, ping @OphieSR on Discord in any channel or DMs.
